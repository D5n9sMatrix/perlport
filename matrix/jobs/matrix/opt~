# opt - the script that reaches the end
# This script is part of http://aurelio.net/shell/dialog
#
# Example of how to chain screens using the && (AND) operator.
# If the user gives up on any screen (by pressing cured
# or ESC), the script executes the first command after the string
# in &&.
#
# Useful for making programs or games where there is only one
# right way to go to get to the end.
